    <h1>Learn the basic rules of Cipher!</h1>
    <h4>
      The object of the game is simple: <b>Destroy your opponent's lord.</b>
    </h4>
    <p>
      The game is set out as a war between two players, as they deploy units
      to destroy the other's army. Each "army" is a deck of 50 cards, with no
      more than 4 copies of the same card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each player starts out by placing one
      1 cost unit from their deck onto the battlefield in the Vanguard Area.
      This unit is that player's lord, and is usually marked with another card
      below it.
      Each player then shuffles their deck and draws 6 cards. They can then
      choose to "mulligan", or shuffle their hand back into the deck and redraw
      the same amount of cards.
      Player's then decide by their method of choosing which player will
      go first (ie. R-P-S or coin flip).
      Once the turn order has been decided, players set aside 5 orbs in the
      orb area. These orbs represent the amount of times each player's lord
      can be attacked before defeat, which will be explained in detail
      <a href="#orb-destroy">later.</a>
    </p>

    <div>
      Once setup has been completed play can commence.
      Each player's turn consists of 5 phases;
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#begin">Beginning Phase</a></li>
        <li><a href="#bond">Bond Phase</a></li>
        <li><a href="#deploy">Deployment Phase</a></li>
        <li><a href="#action">Action Phase</a></li>
        <li><a href="#end">End Phase</a></li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
      Here is a reference to what the set up should look like:
      </p>
      <img src="https://domsalazar.github.io/Cipher-Site/Genealogy/Playmat.jpg" width=90%>
    </div>
    <div id=begin>
      <h3>Beginning Phase</h3>
      In the Beginning phase, players do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Activate any skills which text say "at the start of your turn"</li>
        <li>Untap all units</li>
        <li>Draw one card</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id=bond>
      <h3>Bond Phase</h3>
      The Bond phase is where players can choose one card in their hand and
      place it face up in the bond area. Players may only play one bond
      per turn.
    </div>

    <div id=deploy>
      <h3>Deployment Phase</h3>
      In the Deployment phase, players can tap any number of bonds to deploy a
      unit from their hand. A player may also class change a unit they have on
      the field by tapping a number of bonds equal to the class change cost.
      A unit cannot be deployed if there is already a unit with the same name
      as that unit on that player's side of the field.
      At least one bond tapped must be the same color as the unit being
      deployed or class changed. Flipped bond cards have no color associated.

      <p>
        The Deployment cost is listed in the colored, larger bubble and the
        class change cost is listed below in a smaller orb. When a unit is
        class changed, the player taps the required bonds, stacks the new card
        on top of the unit being class changed, and draws one card. The class
        changed unit must have the same name as the original unit (ie Byleth(f)
        cannot be class changed into Byleth(M)).
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="https://domsalazar.github.io/Cipher-Site/ThreeHouses/Byleth5.png" width=200px>
          The deployment cost of this Byleth(F) is 5, while the class change
          cost is 4.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id=action>
      <h3>Action Phase</h3>
      The action phase covers many options for units. Each unit can activate
      their skills any number of times (limitted by their card text) as long as
      the player pays the cost for each skill. Skills can be activated at any
      point during the action phase.

      <p>
        During the action phase, each untapped unit can tap to do one of the
        following:
        <ul>
          <li>Move into another area on that player's side of the battle</li>
          <li>Attack an enemy unit in range</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <h5 id="orb-destroy">Combat</h5>
        When an ally attacks an enemy unit, each player flips one card from
        the top of their deck and places it in the support area. The Support
        value of the card (located on the bottom right) is added to the attack
        value of that player's unit's attack (located in the bottom left)
        in combat. The support skill of the supporting card
        may activate depending on the conditions of the skill (ie, attacking or
        defending). If the attacking unit's attack value is
        higher or equal to the defending's, the defending unit is destoyed and
        sent to the retreat area. If the defending unit's attack is higher,
        the fight ends without either unit being destroyed. If the defending
        unit was the player's lord and the unit is destroyed, that
        player takes one orb from their orb pile. If the defending player's
        lord is defeated and has no orbs left, the attacking player wins
        the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="https://domsalazar.github.io/Cipher-Site/Genealogy/Seliph1.png" width=200px>
        The attack value of this Seliph is 40, and his support value is 20.
        Seliph also has a support skill that activates when your unit is
        attacking!
      </p>
      <p>
        <h5>Critical/Evasion</h5>
        When attacking/defending, player's may discard a card from their hand
        with the same name as the unit attacking/defending to preform a
        critical hit or an evasion. If your unit is attacking and you discard a
        same name card from your hand, your unit preforms a critical hit
        and their attack value (plus support value) is doubled. If your
        unit is defending and you discard a same name card from your hand,
        your unit "evades" the attack and is not destroyed at the end of the
        combat, regardless of the attack values.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="end">
      <h3>End Phase</h3>
      During the end phase, player's may activate any skills that specify
      activation during this phase, and play passes to the next player.
