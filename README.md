This website is made as a reference directory for a friend of mine, 
as well as for myself. The content of the website is to make playing
Fire Emblem Cipher (a Japanese card game) easier to play for us because
neither of us can read Japanese that well. 

The front page is a directory to all of the other sites. Here you will 
locate your deck and load the site so that you can find the translations 
easily so games can go by quicker. The decks made online are decks that 
we have made in real life, and I plan to include other decks we have made
later. 

By clicking on one of the symbols in the table, you will be taken to the 
site for that respective deck. Each deck site has a table at the top for 
a quick search, and lists all the card names and skills in the descriptions.

At the main page, there is a link to a rules site, which has my basic 
rundown of the rules of cipher. Each section describes what is done in 
that phase of the game. 

Finally there is a link to a site I did not create as a reference to 
where I normally look for Cipher information. This site (serenes forest)
has information on every card released, so I thought it best to include 
a reference as a quick link to find a certain card.
